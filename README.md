# LittleBot
LittleBot was developed for a small and simple two wheel robot. The code within this repository is meant to function with ROS2 Foxy, and run on a Raspberry Pi 3/4. 

## Notes:

Encoder_Counts/Revolution = 1200?
Wheel_Diameter(mm) = 67.77
motor RPM = 100 rpm
motor RPS = 1.66666666666 rps
circumferance = 212.91 mm/rotation
max_drive_speed = 354.85 mm/s
max_drive_speed = 1.16420604 ft/s

//Maybe attach interupt to encoder pin

# Nodes

- A Node is a program that controls a system/sub-system of the robot.
- In ROS, a Node can send and/or recieve data to/from other nodes via topics, services, actions, or parameters.
- A full robotics system is made up of many Nodes working together.
- In ROS 2, a single executable can contain one or more Nodes.
